## Overview 

This is the final solo project for MOD 3 FE students. The task was to pick an API our choosing, a specific audience, and implement a web application designed towards them that utilizes React, Router, and Redux. The API I selected was the PetFinder API and my audience was anyone who was looking to adopt a dog, cat, or rabbit. The web application starts off with a Landing page that welcomes visitors to enter, whereupon they are routed to the /home path and are able to search for all dog or cats or rabbits that are available for adoption across the U.S. If they wish to look for pets available near their zipcode or state they can further refine their search to those parameters. Once the search has been entered, a fetch is performed and the results are populated as cards in the results section. By clicking on one of the cards, a visitor is routed to a Pet Page where the pet they selected is featured with more details about that animal and the contact information if a visitor would like to adopt. They can then click a back button to go back and return to their results.
